# cmc-portfolio-manager
Semi-automated portfolio "manager" for CMC

## Why this project exists
I was managing my portfolio in another app but I started to not like it anymore so I decided to transfer my transactions to CMC.
Problem was that the UI of CMC is good for single entries but I had at least 60 that I needed to move which is very slow and tedios.

This project is not ment to be used in any commercial app as it relies on the user being logged in an being capable of getting the necessary inputs that would allow this to work.
